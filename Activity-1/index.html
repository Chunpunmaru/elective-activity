            <p>I'm very much an indoor person and link to play games and watch anime.
                <br>I take every chances I can to not go outside to the point that I have a streak
                <br>that I have not been outside of the house for more than 5 months and just broke my steak
                <br>recently because <b>I HAVE</b> now to go outside as face to face classes is now starting.

            <h1>GAMES</h1>
            <p>Since I mentioned I <em>love</em> playing games. Here are some games that I've been <br>
                playing and finished recently and some thoughts on them if you don't mind.
            </p>

                    <b>Persona 4 Golden</b>
                    <br> Easily best JRPG and in top 5 of my
                    <br>favorite games. Also the soundtrack <em>slaps!</em>

                    <b>Dragon Quest 11</b>
                    <br>I played it because this series is <i>goated</i> in japan.
                    <br>It not as good as Persona 4, but a very solid game.
                    <br>Also this is the first dragon quest that is ported in PC.

                    <b>Genshin Impact</b>
                    <br> I've been playing it since launch on and off because
                    <br>I get frustrated on some patch on how dry the game
                    <br>after I finished all the events and feels like a
                    <br>most of the time but still the best gacha game out there.

            <p>And that's the game that i've been playing recently. I know that this html page
                <br>is becoming too nerdy and might become cringey if you're not fan of this kind
                <br>of stuffs, but <b>hold still!</b> because there's one more nerdy stuff I will talk about.

            <h1>ANIME and MANGA</h1>
            <p>I've been a long time fan of anime since I was a child, the time when everytime I woke up
                <br>I immediately turn on the T.V switch to G.M.A channel and watch Doreamon, Dragon Ball,
                <br>and Slum Dunk. But my very first, true anime experience, anime that is dubbed in japanese
                <br>with english subtitle on it, it was when I was in first year of junior high school, I can't
                <br> remember specifically but it's either Kuroko no Basket or Sword Art Online. And here are some
                <br>of my favorite anime and manga of all time.
            </p>

            <p>That's my list, I prefer to consume one piece and kingdom in manga form because they are just
                superior than the anime (especially One).</p>
            <br>
            <p>And that's the end of me telling about my hobbies, if you can see mention about talents because I don't have one, I can't sing and dance and will
                <br>only do those if needed like for projects or activity, But I can solve rubics cube though, with a decent average of 20 seconds back when I was
                <br>in grade. Other than that, I'm pretty much there's not really much more about my self, so I hope you found some entertainment in this web page
                <br>wether it is a good kind of bad kind of entertainment.
