            <p>I'm very much an indoor person and link to play games and watch anime.
                I take every chances I can to not go outside to the point that I have a streak
                that I have not been outside of the house for more than 5 months and just broke my steak
                recently because <b>I HAVE</b> now to go outside as face to face classes is now starting.

                    <br>best JRPG and in top 5 of my

                    <b>Dragon Quest 11</b>
                    <br>I played it because this series is <i>goated</i> in japan.
                    It not as good as Persona 4, but a very solid game.
                    Also this is the first dragon quest that is ported in PC.

                    I get frustrated on some patch on how dry the game
                    <br>after I finished all the events and feels like a

        <p>I've been a long time fan of anime since I was a child, the time when everytime I woke up
                I immediately turn on the T.V switch to G.M.A channel and watch Doreamon, Dragon Ball,
                and Slum Dunk. But my very first, true anime experience, anime that is dubbed in japanese
                with english subtitle on it, it was when I was in first year of junior high school, I can't
                remember specifically but it's either Kuroko no Basket or Sword Art Online. And here are some
                of my favorite anime and manga of all time.

        <p>And that's the end of me telling about my hobbies, if you can see mention about talents because I don't
                    have one, I can't sing and dance and will
                    only do those if needed like for projects or activity, But I can solve rubics cube though, with a decent
                    average of 20 seconds back when I was
                    in grade. Other than that, I'm pretty much there's not really much more about my self, so I hope you
                    found some entertainment in this web page
                    wether it is a good kind of bad kind of entertainment.
